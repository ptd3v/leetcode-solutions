# 345. Reverse Vowels of a String
# Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

# My Solution:
class Solution(object):
    def reverseVowels(self, s):
         vowels = 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'
         reverse = [char for char in s if char in vowels]
         new = ''
         for char in s:
            if char in vowels:
                new += reverse.pop()
            else:
                new += char
         return new
